00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,700
Hello and welcome to the capstone.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,770
We've been together now for

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,360
four courses and this capstone is
supposed to be sort of summary.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,640
It's more intimate.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,940
It's more interesting.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,580
So the first thing you're going
to notice about the capstone,

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,390
it is completely open-ended.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,920
It's really exciting as we see what you
students do, the projects that you do,

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,830
it's really neat.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,910
You choose your own data source.

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,030
You're going to be creative.

12
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,770
Some people do projects that are simple,
just kind of to explore their skills,

13
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,800
but other people do something for
work or something.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,240
They're going to put in a portfolio and
or something they're doing for

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,120
a non-profit or there's all
kinds of things that you can do.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,730
So in order to do this,

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,890
we've changed the format a little
bit from the other courses.

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,660
First off, you have some choices.

19
00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:00,750
We have an Honors Track and that gives
you a certificate with Honors Track.

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,220
And so a lot of the assignments
are in the Honors Track

21
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,430
because we know that some of
you actually are in a hurry.

22
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,100
You're doing the whole specialization.

23
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,745
You want to get the certificate and
you want to move on.

24
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:15,440
And so we understand that not everybody
wants to take a long time in this course.

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,150
So you can actually just take the quiz
which is really the final exam for

26
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,530
all the other classes and you can move on.

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,020
If you want to take a slower track,
well, then you take the Honors Track.

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,090
All the assignments then
are going to be peer-graded.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,060
In the Honors Track,
there's no more quizzes.

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,740
And what's really cool about this is
the rules are completely different.

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,490
So if you go in the other courses,

32
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,990
what happens is we tell you're not
allowed to post code to a forum.

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,700
And that's because all
the programming assignments are so

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,220
simple in those first four courses.

35
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,320
And if you just put your code in and get
the answer, we feel that you're cheating

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,100
yourself out of the learning just because
we don't have hundreds of assignments.

37
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,710
If we had hundreds of assignments,
getting through one would be different.

38
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,740
But we have so

39
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,580
few assignments that we want you to
learn in each one of those assignments.

40
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,010
But now you need help and

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,890
you're working on potentially something
completely different than everybody else.

42
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,650
So it's totally okay to use
the forums to get help on your stuff.

43
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,460
You could even take your project.

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,550
You could put your project in GitHub and
you could post a URL to your project

45
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,240
in a form and say hey,
I'm having trouble or take a look at this.

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,530
Can you give me some suggestions?

47
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,120
And so you should use your fellow
students as a resource, right?

48
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,990
You should use our teaching
assistants as a resource.

49
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,240
We want this to be
a learning community and

50
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,030
we want you to function as part of
a learning community in this class.

51
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,261
And so we've changed the rules in a sense,
flip the rules to make collaboration and

52
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:49,760
constructively working together,
the foundation of this capstone.

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,635
And so I hope that you're going to be as
excited about this idea of the capstone as

54
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:55,235
we are and

55
00:02:55,235 --> 00:03:00,350
I really look forward to seeing what it is
that you're going to do in this capstone.
